133397	emotiondata-aman	And hanging out w/ Celeste and Matt was totally awesome 2!!!	joy
133398	emotiondata-aman	Love u all!!	joy
133399	emotiondata-aman	Here I am again!	noemo
133400	emotiondata-aman	Broadcasting this time from the New World.	noemo
133401	emotiondata-aman	It's been a solid half year since I sent word out, and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email.	noemo
133402	emotiondata-aman	Exciting, no?	joy
133403	emotiondata-aman	So, to the task!	noemo
133404	emotiondata-aman	Well.	noemo
133405	emotiondata-aman	where did we leave off?	noemo
133406	emotiondata-aman	I believe it was April, and spring had just arrived.	noemo
133407	emotiondata-aman	I'll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is. So I was going to work one day, headed to one of the hostels around Berlin to pick people up for the tour, and then bring them back to the Brandenburg Gate where the tour starts.	noemo
133408	emotiondata-aman	I had never been to this particular hostel before, and as I entered and gave my little spiel about the tour and asked if anyone wanted to come along, I was met not with a roar of enthusiasm from the hostel residents, but rather a few dull, glass-eyed looks and was generally ignored.	noemo
133409	emotiondata-aman	As I was preparing to leave, one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait, approached me and said hello.	noemo
133410	emotiondata-aman	He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel, hadn't even checked in yet, and just happened to be in the lobby when I was.	noemo
133411	emotiondata-aman	So he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour.	noemo
133412	emotiondata-aman	We had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well.	joy
133413	emotiondata-aman	But it's certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven't seen in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe.	surprise
133414	emotiondata-aman	Fun times.	joy
133415	emotiondata-aman	The rest of April passed rather uneventfully, and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater.	noemo
133416	emotiondata-aman	And this particular piece was by far the best play I have EVER seen.	joy
133417	emotiondata-aman	It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers.	surprise
133418	emotiondata-aman	It's moments like that that remind me why I've chosen theatre as a profession.	noemo
133419	emotiondata-aman	My next big adventure was a trip I took to London at the end of May. I had never been before, and had been planning on this trip for about six months.	noemo
133420	emotiondata-aman	I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost, and see a different side of London life.	joy
133421	emotiondata-aman	It was sooooo much fun!	joy
133422	emotiondata-aman	I saw most of the major sites on my own, and I went to the theater almost every night I was there.	noemo
133423	emotiondata-aman	The show was trash.	disgust
133424	emotiondata-aman	Horrible.	disgust
133425	emotiondata-aman	Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script.	disgust
133426	emotiondata-aman	And interminably long!	disgust
133427	emotiondata-aman	Three hours of horror.	disgust
133428	emotiondata-aman	I wanted to leave at intermission, but my date was really enjoying it (should have been a sign) so we stayed.	joy
133429	emotiondata-aman	I guess the one good thing I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work.	disgust
133430	emotiondata-aman	It was nice to understand that, just wish I didn't have to experience it first hand.	noemo
133431	emotiondata-aman	While in London I also saw Coriolanus at the Globe Theater.	noemo
133432	emotiondata-aman	Now this was amazing.	surprise
133433	emotiondata-aman	Shakespeare, old school.	noemo
133434	emotiondata-aman	The performers were incredible, and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey, the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire.	surprise
133435	emotiondata-aman	That in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more.	joy
133436	emotiondata-aman	I also saw Les Miserables for the first time, and it was fun.	joy
133437	emotiondata-aman	Loved London.	joy
133438	emotiondata-aman	Loved the free museums.	joy
133439	emotiondata-aman	Especially the British Museum.	noemo
133440	emotiondata-aman	Great East London accents.	noemo
133441	emotiondata-aman	Soooo many monuments, including two statues in front of Buckingham Palace that had a conspicuous Communist message.	noemo
133442	emotiondata-aman	It was a worker with a hammer and a peasant woman with a sickle situated behind Queen Victoria's back , and glowering at the palace.	noemo
133443	emotiondata-aman	Now maybe I was just reading too much into this, or maybe I had spent too much time in the eastern bloc talking about Communist symbolism.	noemo
133444	emotiondata-aman	But I don't' think so.	noemo
133445	emotiondata-aman	And the funniest part, the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand.	joy
133446	emotiondata-aman	Curious.	surprise
133447	emotiondata-aman	next time you're in Wellington, watch out for the Kiwi Commies!	noemo
133448	emotiondata-aman	After London came the World Cup.	noemo
133449	emotiondata-aman	Now I have a confession to make: before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish.	noemo
133450	emotiondata-aman	That changed very quickly.	noemo
133451	emotiondata-aman	The hordes of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city, leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans.	surprise
133452	emotiondata-aman	Then there were the Brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures, and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs.	joy
133453	emotiondata-aman	Loads of fun.	joy
133454	emotiondata-aman	I didn't have tickets to any of the games, but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality that was playing to watch the match.	noemo
133455	emotiondata-aman	So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game, a Tapas bar when Spain played, drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians, etc. It was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds.	joy
133456	emotiondata-aman	And let me tell you how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city, and Germany as a nation.	noemo
133457	emotiondata-aman	Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup.	surprise
133458	emotiondata-aman	Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began, if you waved a German flag in the streets, you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter.	noemo
133459	emotiondata-aman	You have to understand that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity (and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind) since the Second World War.	noemo
133460	emotiondata-aman	And for what it's worth I agree with them, it makes me nervous too.	fear
133461	emotiondata-aman	So.	noemo
133462	emotiondata-aman	People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments.	joy

148440	isear	First weekend back home after one week at Uni I scolded one of my sister's best friends for using our telephone. Very silly, but I was annoyed because she was there at a time when I needed to be with my family.	shame
148441	isear	When my Bictorian \friend\" was staying at my house we ere going á|places together, and sleeping together. At the time I had a á|boyfriend locally. The first time I had to face him after á|sleeping with the guy from Melbourne I felt very guilty."	guilt

148444	isear	Anger at doctors for their treatment of me after giving birth. They left part of placenta behind and I bled heavily for twelve weeks - due to this, I felt weak and emotional, and they said I needed psychiatric treatment and give me no support.	anger

148452	isear	My mother left my father for his best friend, and he moved to Papua New Guinea. Despite the fact that I am closer to my father than to anyone else in my family, I had to move in with my mother, and say good-bye to my father, not knowing when I would see him again.	sadness
148453	isear	When I discovered my mother had been having an affair with my father's best friend, and then ran away with him without even speaking to me about what she was doing letting me come home from school simply to find her gone. I was filled with disgust and contempt.	disgust

148455	isear	I once stole a shirt from the Department Store in which I work. I have been promoted to work in a very privileged section of the store. Their belief in my integrity makes me feel even guiltier.	guilt

148463	isear	When I finished my exams after 12th Grade, I was worried about getting a T.E. Score high enough for Physiotherapy. When I found that I had been accepted I was ecstatic, or more appropriately, could jump for joy.	joy
148464	isear	When going for my driver's licence for the third time, because everything, it seemed, hinged on getting it. I was really nervous, and the testing Officer made me a little afraid as well. There were lots of things to worry about. I passed however.	fear
148465	isear	When a so-called friend let me down, when she promised to tell me when a certain concert was occurring, and that she'd get me tickets. I was really looking forward to it. She did nothing, just told me out of the blue one day what a fantastic concert it was going to be.	anger

148468	isear	I went to visit Montrose home for crippled children to interview a handicapped child. I interviewed two boys and it went really well. I promised I would visit them, but never got the time. Now I hope they've forgotten me, but I feel ashamed of letting them down.	shame
148469	isear	I was driving my parents' car into a carpark in front of a shop we own, and scraped the corner of the front panel on the back corner of my father's utility. I didn't tell anyone, I lied about the bump (later I had to confess).	guilt
148470	isear	Two years ago, somebody I like very much wanted to give up his studies. I tried to make him understand the importance of what he was going to do, not only of the difficulty to find a job but also because he will decrease his culture etc. This person made the test to the college entrance examination and to our great joy we found out that he succeded in entering at the University.	joy
148471	isear	One night, when I got out from the University I saw two strange people near my car. When I got near, they moved away, and then came close again. I had a feeling that they were assaulters. After I left I discovered that the windshield was broken.	fear
148472	isear	One day in a crossroad somebody crashed my car. I got out and this person laughed at me. I felt such a great anger that I got in my car and went away.	anger

148476	isear	When I was a little girl about eight years old I broke the bey from a closed. Mother asked who did it. I said that it wasn't me, as I almost never lied, and my brother did it more frequently in spite my brother denieing it my mother gave him a few slaps.	guilt

201759	tales-emotion	He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.	fear
201760	tales-emotion	The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted.	noemo
201761	tales-emotion	He pulled the cart crossways, and held down his whip.	noemo
201762	tales-emotion	"Hallo?	noemo
201763	tales-emotion	Where are you going to?"--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.	noemo
201764	tales-emotion	"Are you deaf?	noemo
201765	tales-emotion	Are you going to market?"	noemo

201771	tales-emotion	The grocer flicked his whip-- "Papers?	disgust
201772	tales-emotion	Pig license?"	disgust
201773	tales-emotion	Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers.	noemo
201774	tales-emotion	The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied.	disgust
201775	tales-emotion	"This here pig is a young lady; is her name Alexander?"	surprise
201776	tales-emotion	Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.	noemo
201777	tales-emotion	The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper--"Lost, stolen or strayed, 10S. reward;" he looked suspiciously at Pig-wig.	anger
201778	tales-emotion	Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for the ploughman.	noemo
201779	tales-emotion	"You wait here while I drive on and speak to him," said the grocer, gathering up the reins.	noemo
201780	tales-emotion	He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a VERY lame pig could never run!	noemo
201781	tales-emotion	"Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back."	fear
201782	tales-emotion	The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road.	noemo
201783	tales-emotion	Then he looked over at his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman.	noemo
201784	tales-emotion	"Now, Pig-wig, NOW!" said Pigling Bland.	fear
201785	tales-emotion	Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran!	noemo
201786	tales-emotion	They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge.	noemo
201787	tales-emotion	Little fat Pig- wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped.	fear
201788	tales-emotion	They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.	noemo
201789	tales-emotion	They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!	joy
201790	tales-emotion	This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.	noemo
201791	tales-emotion	He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.	noemo
201792	tales-emotion	In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.	noemo
201793	tales-emotion	One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green-- Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.	noemo
201794	tales-emotion	They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.	noemo
201795	tales-emotion	Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.	noemo
201796	tales-emotion	They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.	noemo
201797	tales-emotion	Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--	noemo
201798	tales-emotion	"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?"	noemo
201799	tales-emotion	But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners.	noemo
201800	tales-emotion	He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing--	noemo
201801	tales-emotion	"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!	noemo
201802	tales-emotion	A little wee man, in a red red coat!	noemo
201803	tales-emotion	A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat; If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat."	noemo
201804	tales-emotion	Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.	disgust
201805	tales-emotion	He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.	disgust
201806	tales-emotion	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.	noemo
201807	tales-emotion	But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--	noemo
201808	tales-emotion	"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?"	noemo
201809	tales-emotion	But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--	noemo
201810	tales-emotion	"Old Mr. B!	joy
201811	tales-emotion	Riddle-me-ree!	joy
201812	tales-emotion	Hitty Pitty within the wall, Hitty Pitty without the wall; If you touch Hitty Pitty, Hitty Pitty will bite you!"	joy
201813	tales-emotion	Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.	surprise
201814	tales-emotion	Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--	noemo
201815	tales-emotion	"A house full, a hole full!	noemo
201816	tales-emotion	And you cannot gather a bowl-full!"	noemo
201817	tales-emotion	The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.	noemo
201818	tales-emotion	But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.	noemo
201819	tales-emotion	On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.	noemo
201820	tales-emotion	They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.	noemo
201821	tales-emotion	Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all.	noemo
201822	tales-emotion	He ran in front, singing--	noemo
201823	tales-emotion	"The man in the wilderness said to me, `How may strawberries grow in the sea?'	joy
201824	tales-emotion	I answered him as I thought good-- `As many red herrings as grow in the wood."'	joy
201825	tales-emotion	But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.	noemo
201826	tales-emotion	On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown.	noemo
201827	tales-emotion	Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.	noemo
201828	tales-emotion	But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--	noemo
201829	tales-emotion	"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!	joy
201830	tales-emotion	Flour of England, fruit of Spain, Met together in a shower of rain; Put in a bag tied round with a string, If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!"	joy
201831	tales-emotion	Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.	noemo
201832	tales-emotion	The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.	noemo
201833	tales-emotion	On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone.	noemo
201834	tales-emotion	They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.	noemo
201835	tales-emotion	But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--	noemo
201836	tales-emotion	"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz!	joy
201837	tales-emotion	Hum-a-bum buzz!	joy
201838	tales-emotion	As I went over Tipple-tine I met a flock of bonny swine; Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!	joy
201839	tales-emotion	They were the very bonniest swine That e'er went over the Tipple-tine."	joy
201840	tales-emotion	Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.	disgust
201841	tales-emotion	But he ate up the honey!	noemo
201842	tales-emotion	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.	noemo
201843	tales-emotion	But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.	noemo
201844	tales-emotion	On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.	noemo
201845	tales-emotion	But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--	joy
201846	tales-emotion	"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck, With a white counterpane round his neck, Forty doctors and forty wrights, Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!"	joy
201847	tales-emotion	Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again.	noemo
201848	tales-emotion	But still he did not speak.	noemo

201857	tales-emotion	Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!	noemo
201858	tales-emotion	. . .	noemo
201859	tales-emotion	Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud "Squeak!"	surprise
201860	tales-emotion	The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.	fear
201861	tales-emotion	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.	fear
